<b><u>Be a part of SigCHI!</u></b>
<br>
If you want to learn more or get involved with Human-Computer Interaction and Information
Architecture, just <!--walk into one of our
meetings which are now <b>Thursdays @ 8PM, note this change</b> -- location stemming from the ACM office (1225 DCL)</b>
and--> <a href="http://clortho.acm.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/sigchi-l">join the SigCHI mailing list</a>. Meet people with similar interests!

<br><br>


<b><u>What we're up to:</u></b> <br>
<ul>
<li>Read SIG CHI's <a href="2004_2005_plan.pdf">2004-2005 plan</a>. [<i>Sunday, April 12<sup>th</sup> 2004.</i>]</li>
<br>
<!--<li><u>Semester/year project</u> We
are developing a system that converts photographs to (shaded) line drawings,
and teaches you how to draw. It will make use of the increasingly popular
Tablet PC and Wacom-style technology. <i>Fall 2003</i><br><br> -->
<li>We'll be
going on tours of labs here at UIUC doing HCI research sometime soon. Expect
an email from Amy on this. But ya have to be on the <a
href="http://clortho.acm.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/sigchi-l">mailing list!</a>
<br><br> <li>The <a href="gmi/">GMI</a> executable and source code is now
available under the BSD license. I also made a little logo for the project.
[<i>Monday, March 17<sup>th</sup> 2003.</i>] <br><br> </ul>

Backburner idea: Open Source User Interface Project
Open Source software is great because any the feature imaginable can be added to it right? If only the interfaces made more sense and/or resembled their commercial counterparts. Let's fix it up...

<b><u>About SigCHI</u></b>
<br>
SigCHI covers the software, hardware and human aspects of interaction with computers. This is truly an <i>interdisciplinary</i> forum. Psychology, Kinesiology, Library & Information Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Foreign Languages, Computer Science, and plenty more areas, even History, have critical influences on the field of HCI.

We're a group interested in interactive computing systems for human use, i.e. the WWW, the Mouse, crazy concepts like that, but so much more.

This is a very general subject, and all levels of computing prowess shall feel right at home.
<br><br>
This field within Computer Science exists because people use computers so damn much that it's pretty important that we use them well. People can and should have more fun when interacting with the digital world...and while we're out fixing things, why not let them do it more productively. HCI is so diverse, you have the opportunity to learn a lot: guaranteed.
