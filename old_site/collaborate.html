Don was talking more about the entertainment group idea and I like it a lot. He envisions mostly the 
entertainment side of it, but I see entertainment as just one component of many 
(http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/ahri/projects). ACM can do cool stuff that would infiltrate and revitalize 
UIUC's quasi-dormant Active Spaces research with some real (demoable) applications. Apparently Marc Snir 
likes this type of stuff too, so we'd probably get access and support for any necessary resources.

It should be in the mission of SigEntaMation (1) to work in a collaborative manner with other SIGs such 
that it does not detract from the cardinality of the members of other SIGs.  SigEntaMation should seek to 
become a purely project-based SIG which works with the more teaching-oriented SIGs to build our 
interdisciplinary team.(2)  For that reason, I hope that SigCHI will continue to exist and hopefully 
collaborate with our new SIG in the future.
 
 (1) - Note this name is not final, nor is its distinct capitalization.
 Possible alternatives include, but are not limited to, Sigentamation,
 SigEntamation, SigMation, SigEnt, and JustAnotherSIG.
 
 (2) - My opinions do not necessarily reflect the opinions of this yet
 unformed and unnamed SIG.  The purely socialist collective that will become
 said SIG may have different opinions.

Yeahhh...EnZigMation (pronounce of possible "EntSigMation" abbreviation 
order) would have subprojects within the scope of its application to a 
home/work environment that relate directly into SIG(s, with likely 
overlap of even the subprojects).

The thing is, even if @dream@ SigOps hacks GAIA or something
to integrate everything, and SigGraph coded a 3D human model display of my 
SigArt smart home management avatar, and SigArch makes the weather burn 
into my breakfast toast, and CHI lets me Minority Report the morning 
news, and WinDevils lets me access my music collection via speech, and 
MacWarriors has me browsing for files in 3D on a Plasma HDTV (with the 
sexy 3D human model still in Picture-in-picture) @/dream@, each SIG 
involved is working on a project that may or may not be of interest to 
the majority of its members. Sure a SIG can do a separate project 
that's not interdisciplinary, but success is more realizable with focus 
on one project at a time.

The idea of an integrated ACM project monstrousity is orgasmic. Also, 
this discussion is good for figuring out a structure setup.
