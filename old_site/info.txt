Allo there,

On this momentous occasion, we shall be discussing:
- Any projects/jobs/etc we have or have had, to get an idea of
everyone's backgrounds and best-suited contribution.
- Engineering Open House (EOH) Project ideas
- What everyone's noticed about their operating system, a program, or
website that has pissed them off recently
- Beckman and DCL research
- If there's interest, I may give a brief history of HCI and say what I
know of who's who/what's what in HCI history, and current research.
- Other stuff?

If you show up late, check for us outside on the Engineering quad...or
call my cell phone 217-417-5449.

 - Joshua Benjamin
